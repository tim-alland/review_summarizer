    "The LLM being employed is Meta's llama-3-70b-instruct. This LLM pipeline works by scraping reviews from the Amazon url and passing them to the LLM to distill each one down to a principal complaint or praise. Then, it passes these distilled versions back into the LLM again where it consolidates similar reviews and provides an overarching summary."
